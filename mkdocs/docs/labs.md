# Epsilon Labs 

[EpsilonLabs](https://github.com/epsilonlabs) is a satellite project of Epsilon on GitHub that hosts experimental stuff which may (or may not) end up being part of Epsilon in the future. It also hosts contributions that are incompatible with EPL and therefore cannot be hosted under eclipse.org.

!!! warning
    Please be aware that the code contributed under EpsilonLabs is not part of (or in any other way formally related to) Eclipse, and has not been IP-checked by the Eclipse legal team.
